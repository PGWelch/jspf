## What JSPF does ... ##

The _Java Simple Plugin Framework_ was built to reduce development time while increasing code maintainability of small to medium sized projects.

  * Completely hides implementation details of  components.  **Only use their interfaces**.
  * Components may be loaded with only **two(!) lines of code**
  * Heavily **annotation based**: [@PluginImplementation](http://data.xeoh.net/jspf/api/net/xeoh/plugins/base/annotations/PluginImplementation.html), [@InjectPlugin](http://data.xeoh.net/jspf/api/net/xeoh/plugins/base/annotations/injections/InjectPlugin.html), [@PluginLoaded](http://data.xeoh.net/jspf/api/net/xeoh/plugins/base/annotations/events/PluginLoaded.html), [@Timer](http://data.xeoh.net/jspf/api/net/xeoh/plugins/base/annotations/Timer.html) and [@Thread](http://data.xeoh.net/jspf/api/net/xeoh/plugins/base/annotations/Thread.html), ...
  * Through usage of generics it is usually **type safe**.
  * Additional plugins to export other plugins by  **JavaScript**, **JSON**, **LipeRMI**, **XMLRPC**, **XMLRPC Delight** or **ERMI**. Plugins may be discovered on the local net using **ZeroConf**.


(See the [Usage Guide](UsageGuide.md), [API](http://data.xeoh.net/jspf/api/) , [FAQ](FAQ.md),  Introduction-Video (see video below) for more information). A new [discussion group](http://groups.google.com/group/jspf) for help and support has also been created.

The only things that changed since the creation of the video are that `.toURL()` is not required anymore and that instead of `File("bin/")`, you could start with `ClassURI.CLASSPATH` right away; see the short example below). A [high quality version of the video can be downloaded here](http://data.xeoh.net/jspf/jspf.video.mov), or watched on youtube directly (click video).

## What is new in this version (1.0.2, May 2011) ##

**Updated** RC1 -> RC3: Workaround for large classpaths. See Discussion Groups. <br />
**Updated** RC3 -> RC4: Added warnings for some common programming mistakes. <br />
**Updated** RC4 -> Final: Minor bug fixes. Added ClassURI.CLASSPATH<br />
**Updated** Final -> 1.0.1: Fixed doubled InformationBroker bug<br />
**Updated** 1.0.1 -> 1.0.2: ClassURI.CLASSPATH now also works when JSPF is loaded dynamically (like in application servers)<br />

  * Complete overhaul of the [InformationBroker](http://data.xeoh.net/jspf/api/net/xeoh/plugins/informationbroker/InformationBroker.html) (looks good now :-)
  * Added support for multiplugins (plugins consisting of several JARs sharing the same classloader, see the  [FAQ](FAQ.md))
  * jCores added (see http://jcores.net)
  * Added initial version of 'classpath://x.`*`' ... patterns (see [Issue #21](http://code.google.com/p/jspf/issues/detail?id=21))
  * Improved debugging facilities (see [OptionReportAfter](http://data.xeoh.net/jspf/api/net/xeoh/plugins/base/options/addpluginsfrom/OptionReportAfter.html))
  * Dropped some less frequently used features (e.g., supervision, pluglets, ...)
  * Autodiscovery is an abomination ... redone the fast, local lookup again.
  * Reworked plugin manager internals (still not finished)
  * Changed JSON URL generation again (and it will have to be replaced once more in the future, sorry for that)
  * Fixed another LipeRMI bug concerning methods of superclasses
  * Added warning when getPlugin() is being misused.
  * Fixed console output
  * Some minor bug fixes

See [the version history](VersionHistory.md) for changes in the past.

## A short example ##

The following lines demonstrate how easy it is to load existing plugins. All .JAR files inside the given directory will be examined for contained plugins which will be loaded afterwards and are automatically started. No configuration files are required, nothing else has to be done.

```
PluginManager pm = PluginManagerFactory.createPluginManager();

// and then one or more of these ...

pm.addPluginsFrom(ClassURI.CLASSPATH);
pm.addPluginsFrom(ClassURI.PLUGIN(PluginImpl.class));
pm.addPluginsFrom(new File("plugins/").toURI());
pm.addPluginsFrom(new File("plugins/plugin.jar").toURI());
pm.addPluginsFrom(new URI("http://jspf.googlecode.com/files/coolplugin.jar"));
```


Creating a new plugin is equally straightforward. After an interface has been designed (which only has to extend `Plugin`) the rest can be done by a simple annotation. The next example shows a plugin implementation that could be loaded by JSPF, and also here: no XML- or whatsoever-files have to be created to make this work.

```
/**
 * CoolPlugin may be an (almost) arbitrary interface, in only has to **extend Plugin**.
 */
@PluginImplementation
public class CoolPluginImpl implements CoolPlugin {

    public String provideData() {
        return "Hello World";
    }

}
```

Our last two snippets show how plugins can be obtained from outside, and the inside of plugins. Notice the type-safety:

```
CoolPlugin cool = pm.getPlugin(CoolPlugin.class);
```

Or, from  inside of plugins:
```
@InjectPlugin
public CoolPlugin cool;
```


<br />


## When to use it ##

If you

  * are, for example, a researcher and want to develop a prototype quickly
  * intend to change implementations frequently but want to keep your code clean
  * are coding some software where you expect plugins to be loaded using some kind of easy IoC
  * think about reusing components in other prototypes

then you might want to give it a try.

## Functionality Checklist ##
<span>(aka the unbiased JSPF-is-great feature matrix)</span>


Below you find a brief overview of the _most important_ features JSPF has to offer. This list is not complete, and the framework offers various other goodies here and there, like flexible options, easy configuration support and some more.

| **Feature** | **JSPF** |
|:------------|:---------|
| Can load ... plugins from JAR files | <span>Yes</span> |
| ... multiple plugins from a directory  | Yes      |
| ... automatically all plugins in classpath | Yes      |
| ... plugins over HTTP | Yes (1)  |
| Threadsafe  |  Yes     |
| Typesafe    |  Yes     |
| Dependency Injection |  Yes     |
| Simple, XML free configuration |  Yes     |
| Heavily annotation based  |  Yes     |
| Supports caching |  Yes     |
| Plugins can be isolated using a separate ClassLoader  |  Yes (2) |
| Official support to export plugins over ... ERMI  |  Yes     |
|  ... LipeRMI |  Yes (3) |
| ... JSON  (easily export Plugins to web pages!) |  Yes     |
| ... XMLRPC  |  Yes     |
| Transparent and easy network callbacks |  Yes  (w. LipeRMI) |
| Remote plugins may be discovered automatically |  Yes     |
| Requires Java version  |  >=6.0   |
| Supported Platforms |  Windows, Mac, Linux |
| Works in applets |  Yes (4) |
| Time to get started | 5 minutes (6) |
| License     | Free (beer and speech) |
| Proper end user documentation  | It's improving :-) |

(**1**) Works, but unsafe and not recommended.<br />
(**2**) Only if the plugins are packed into a self contained JAR.<br />
(**3**) We even use a greatly enhanced version of LipeRMI with fewer bugs and more featues.<br />
(**4**) Applets have to be signed, does not work with classpath autodetection <br />
(**6**) If you [watch the introduction video](http://data.xeoh.net/jspf/jspf.video.mov) and have profound Java experience.
